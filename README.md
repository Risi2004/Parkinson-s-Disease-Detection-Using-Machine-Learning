# Parkinson-s-Disease-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning

This project builds a Machine Learning model to detect **Parkinson's Disease** using biomedical voice measurements.  
The model is trained using the **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** algorithm and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between healthy individuals and patients with Parkinson’s.
